The optimization of CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machining processes is essential for enhancing productivity, product quality, and sustainability in manufacturing. This paper presents an approach for optimizing CNC milling parameters using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), incorporating multiple objective functions beyond traditional ones like surface roughness and machining time. The proposed model integrates critical parameters such as tool wear rate (TWR), cutting force, vibration index, power consumption, and surface integrity into a unified optimization framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed PSO-based model minimizes machining time, improves surface finish, and optimizes power consumption and tool wear simultaneously. The findings offer valuable insights for improving the efficiency and quality of CNC machining processes in real-world industrial applications

1. Introduction



CNC machining is a cornerstone of modern manufacturing, enabling precision, flexibility, and automation across various industries. Optimizing machining parameters—cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut—has long been a key focus for improving machining efficiency and product quality. Traditionally, these optimization efforts have primarily targeted surface roughness or machining time. However, additional factors such as tool wear, cutting force, vibration, and power consumption significantly affect machining performance and sustainability, yet have often been overlooked in classical optimization models.
This research aims to bridge this gap by proposing an enhanced optimization model that incorporates multiple performance metrics. We utilize Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO), a population-based optimization algorithm, to minimize a composite objective function that accounts for machining time, surface roughness, tool wear rate, cutting force, vibration index, and power consumption. This multi-objective approach ensures a more holistic solution for CNC milling optimization, improving not only operational efficiency but also sustainability and product quality
